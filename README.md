Hi, I'm David! Freelance full stack web developer since 2011.

My goal: To be as self-directed as possible so that you can get back to running your business instead of managing me.

Happy to fit into your existing process or I can manage the project myself with a weekly check-in call.

My preferred stack is React.js, TailwindCSS, and Next.js deployed to Vercel, but I also have experience with Vue.js, Express.js, and Netlify.

Open to contracting at $100/hr up to 20 hours a week, or we can negotiate a fixed-price, fixed-scope project.

I'd love to schedule a free 30 minute call to talk about your project:
