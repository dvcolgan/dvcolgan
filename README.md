Hi, I'm David! Freelance full stack web developer since 2011.

My goal: To be as self-directed as possible so that you can get back to running your business instead of managing me.

Happy to fit into your existing process or I can manage the project myself with a weekly check-in call.

Deep experience in the Python and Javascript worlds. I have been using Django since 1.6. I was there when React was born. TailwindCSS made styling fun again.

My preferred technologies are currently React, TailwindCSS, Next.js, and Phaser.js deployed to Vercel, but I can use any Python or Javascript tooling.

Some demos:

- A tech talk at Indianapolis Python about my philosophy of Django: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRIHAV91144

- A tech talk at Vim Chicago hosted by Hashrocket demoing my Vim-fu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WF4fr8ibk

- Timelapse of me making a PhaserJS game in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 28: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLYY74i9Ark

- A demo of my full stack browser-based game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNnUSbanP_c

Open to contracting at $100/hr up to 20 hours a week, or we can negotiate a fixed-price, fixed-scope project.

I'd love to schedule a free 30 minute call to talk about your project:
