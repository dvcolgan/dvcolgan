Hi, I'm David. I specialize in Django/Python contracting and have over 10 years of professional experience building and maintaining Django apps.

My goal: To be as self-directed as possible so that you can get back to running your business instead of managing me.

Happy to fit into your existing process or I can manage the project myself with a weekly check-in call.

Open to contracting at $125/hr up to 20 hours a week, or we can negotiate a fixed-price, fixed-scope project.

Here is a tech talk I gave at Indianapolis Python about my philosophy of Django: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRIHAV91144

I'd love to schedule a free 30 minute call to talk about your project:
