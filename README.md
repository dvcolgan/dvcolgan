Hi, I'm David! Freelance full stack Django/Python web developer for over 10 years. I have been using Django since 1.6.

My goal: To be as self-directed as possible so that you can get back to running your business instead of managing me.

Happy to fit into your existing process or I can manage the project myself with a weekly check-in call.

I have deep experience in the Python world and enough Javascript to wrangle whatever frontend you have. Excited about HTMX and Alpine.js.
ript tooling.

Some demos:

A tech talk at Indianapolis Python about my philosophy of Django: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRIHAV91144

A demo of my full stack browser-based game written in Django: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNnUSbanP_c

Open to contracting at $125/hr up to 20 hours a week, or we can negotiate a fixed-price, fixed-scope project.

I'd love to schedule a free 30 minute call to talk about your project:
